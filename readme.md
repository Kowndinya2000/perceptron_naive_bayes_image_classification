## Project : Face and Digit Classification

### 1. Implement three classification algorithms for detecting faces and classifying digits:
    ```(a) Perceptron```
    ```(b) Naive Bayes Classifier```
    ```(c) Any other algorithm of your choice (examples include K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees).```
### 2. Design the features for each of the three problems, and write a program for extracting the features from each image.
### 3. Train the three algorithms on the part of the data set that is reserved for training. 
    ```First, use only 10% of the data points that are reserved for training, then 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and finally 100%. All the results should a function of the number of data points used for training.```
### 4. Compare the performances of the three algorithms using the part of the data set that is reserved for testing, and report:
    ```• The time needed for training as a function of the number of data points used for training.```
    ```• The prediction error (and standard deviation) as a function of the number of data points used for training.```
### 5. Write a report describing the implemented algorithms and discussing the results and the learned lessons.
